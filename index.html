    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
      Most of the literature in our corpus involves travel of some sort. We see many characters crossing the border and settling elsewhere, or moving out of their homes in a bid for safety. In this project, we attempt to examine travel patterns through a gendered lens. 
      While mapping out the paths for the characters based on their gender, we hypothesised that on an average, men travelled more than women. However, the resulting map proved our hypothesis wrong. Women had travelled a greater average distance than men. On examining the data, we theorised that one reason for this could be that there were many more male characters than female characters and a lot of these male characters were throwaways who only appeared in a single location. When the narrative focused on a female character, they were more likely to be “important” i.e. someone who travelled. 
      We also found that there were some areas which were more travelled than others. We attempt to carry forward this analysis by also adding a temporal aspect. The corpus is classified into five large time periods. We examine the character paths according to these time zones, segregated by gender. Based on our findings from the previous project, our hypothesis is now this: We will find men and women both travelling during the partition, but after the partition, we will find men travelling more (???)

      We also zoom in on any data points that we find particularly interesting.
