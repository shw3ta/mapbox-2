    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    
    <p>The Partition was a period in Indian history that was partly characterized by mass travel. In our corpus of Partition texts, we see this reflected.</p>
    <p>
      Most of the literature in our corpus involves travel of some sort. We see many characters crossing the border and settling elsewhere, or moving out of their homes in a bid for safety. In this project, we attempt to examine travel patterns through a gendered lens. 
      While mapping out the paths for the characters based on their gender, we hypothesised that on an average, men travelled more than women. However, the resulting map proved our hypothesis wrong. Women had travelled a greater average distance than men. On examining the data, we theorised that one reason for this could be that there were many more male characters than female characters and a lot of these male characters were throwaways who only appeared in a single location. When the narrative focused on a female character, they were more likely to be “important” i.e. someone who travelled. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We also found that there were some areas which were more travelled than others. We attempt to carry forward this analysis by also adding a temporal aspect. The corpus is classified into five large time periods. We examine the character paths according to these time zones, segregated by gender. Based on our findings from the previous project, our hypothesis is now this: We will see both genders travelling during the Partition, but fewer women travelling in the Pre- and Post-Partition periods.
    </p>

    <h3>What Does the Map Show?</h3>
    <p>
      The trajectories of both men and women in the Partition Database are visible, with women in green and men in blue. The toggle allows viewers to switch between viewing the paths taken by males and/or females. We observe that there is a particularly dense set of paths going across the border near Amritsar and Lahore.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is expected, as a lot of characters do end up crossing the border in this corpus. There seems to be fairly the same number of men and women who do this.

    <h3>Toggle Temporality</h3>
    <p>
      Here, we attempt to spot any patterns through the lens of temporality. The slider allows you to toggle between the following 5 temporal categories:
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-Partition (before 1947-08-14)</li>
        <li>During Partition (1947-08-15 - 1948-02-28)</li>
        <li>Post-Partition (1948-03-01 - 1971-12-16)</li>
        <li>Long Partition (after 1971-12-16)</li>
        <li>Indeterminable</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    We also added a sixth option, which shows all the paths that have not been temporally coded in the database.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon switching through, we can see that in the datapoints we do have, men have travelled more in the Pre Partition and Post Partition periods. What is also transparent is that most paths have not been temporally coded, which severely skews any analysis we can make from this map.       
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: the temporality you set in this section will apply to what you see when you scroll to other sections.

    <h3>Observations</h3>
    <p>
      An unfortunate drawback in our database was the absence of temporality data. However, we cross-checked with the data on QGIS, and a majority of the female paths crossing the border occurred during the partition.
      There are quite a few female paths in the Indeterminable section, which seem to be from the work A Life Long Ago, which is set largely in the 1950s, and as such, is the only work that majorly features women travelling post-partition. The other prominent travel paths are the long ones from India to the UK, one female and one male, which come from Sunlight on a Broken Column. 
      Apart from these exceptions, we observe that while during Partition, there was extensive travel for both genders, in the Pre- and Post-Partition periods, it was primarily men travelling.
    </p>
    <p>< enter plot here ></p>
    <p>
      A possible reason for this follows from the analysis we did about the travel patterns of women in general. There were rarely any throwaway women characters, and in stories set during the partition, most women who were present ended up travelling. However, once the Partition was done, more women tended to stick to one place. 
      Despite the fact that women travelled a greater average distance, it seems to be concentrated to a single time period.

    <h3>Conclusion and Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      In conclusion, we can tentatively say that what we have shown here is in support of our hypothesis with respect to the travel patterns of males and females through time, with respect to the events of the Partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one cannot make a concrete conclusion based on what we have seen here, since the data available to us is a very small subset of the whole database. Moving forward, we can make the effort to track more temporal information on the main database.
    </p>
    <p>It is to be noted that our results are also very much a function of the kind of texts that make up our corpus. We had a fairly even split of male and female authors. As we saw, there were quite a few notable female characters who undertook long journeys. It is interesting that our major intuitive hypothesis about women travelling less than men was proven wrong.</p>
    <p>However, we seem to be correct about the time periods in which they have travelled. Apart from the main cast of Sunlight on a Broken Column and A Life Long Ago (whose travel is notable because they are main characters), we rarely saw women undertaking long journeys. </p>
    <p>The Partition was not just a spatial phenomenon. It is important to place the events of the Partition in the context of time to understand not just what people's experiences looked like leading up to the partition itself, but more importantly, its lasting impacts on accessibility of space to different people.
