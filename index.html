      Most of the literature in our corpus involves travel of some sort. We see many characters crossing the border and settling elsewhere, or moving out of their homes in a bid for safety. In this project, we attempt to examine travel patterns through a gendered lens. 
      While mapping out the paths for the characters based on their gender, we hypothesised that on an average, men travelled more than women. However, the resulting map proved our hypothesis wrong. Women had travelled a greater average distance than men. On examining the data, we theorised that one reason for this could be that there were many more male characters than female characters and a lot of these male characters were throwaways who only appeared in a single location. When the narrative focused on a female character, they were more likely to be “important” i.e. someone who travelled. 
      We also found that there were some areas which were more travelled than others. We attempt to carry forward this analysis by also adding a temporal aspect. The corpus is classified into five large time periods. We examine the character paths according to these time zones, segregated by gender. Based on our findings from the previous project, our hypothesis is now this: We will find men and women both travelling during the partition, but after the partition, we will find men travelling more (???)

      We also zoom in on any data points that we find particularly interesting.

      The trajectories of both men and women are visible, with women in green and men in purple. The toggle allows viewers to switch between the male paths and the female paths. We observe that there is a particularly dense set of paths going across the border near Amritsar and Lahore.
      This is expected, as a lot of characters do end up crossing the border in this corpus. There seems to be fairly the same number of men and women who do this.

      Here, we attempt to spot any patterns through the lens of temporality. The slider is divided into five sections: Pre-Partition, During Partition, Post Partition, Long After Partition, and Indeterminable. To account for the gaps in the database, we also have a sixth option, for when the temporality is not mentioned. 
      Upon switching through, we can see that in the datapoints we do have, men have travelled more in the Pre Partition and Post Partition periods.

      An unfortunate drawback in our database was the absence of temporality data. However, we cross-checked with the data on QGIS, and a majority of the female paths crossing the border occurred during the partition.
      There are quite a few female paths in the Indeterminable section, which seem to be from the work A Life Long Ago, which is set largely in the 1950s, and as such, is the only work that majorly features women travelling post-partition. The other prominent travel paths are the long ones from India to the UK, one female and one male, which come from Sunlight on a Broken Column. 
      Apart from these exceptions, we observe that while during Partition, there was extensive travel for both genders, in the Pre- and Post-Partition periods, it was primarily men travelling.
      A possible reason for this follows from the analysis we did about the travel patterns of women in general. There were rarely any throwaway women characters, and in stories set during the partition, most women who were present ended up travelling. However, once the Partition was done, more women tended to stick to one place. 
      Despite the fact that women travelled a greater average distance, it seems to be concentrated to a single time period.

      In conclusion, we can tentatively say that our hypothesis about the travel patterns on men and women based on temporality seems to be correct. 
      However, it is difficult to come to any sort of concrete conclusion based on the incomplete data about temporality we have. 
      Our next steps would be to furnish the database more fully, so as to more rigorously examine gendered travel patterns across time.
